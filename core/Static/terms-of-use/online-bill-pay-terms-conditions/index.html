FIS is an independent third party not affiliated with  EpicEuro .</p><p><strong>SERVICE DEFINITIONS</strong></p><ul><li>"Service" means the Online Bill Payment Service offered by EpicEuro Bank, N.A., through Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.</li><li>"Agreement" means these terms and conditions of the EpicEuro Online Bill Payment Service.</li><li>"Payee" is the person or entity to which you wish a payment to be directed or is the person or entity from which you receive electronic bills, as the case may be.</li><li>"Payment Instruction" is the information provided by you to the Service for a payment to be made to the Payee (such as, but not limited to, Payee name, Payee account number, and Scheduled Payment Date).</li><li>"Payment Account" is the EpicEuro checking account, chosen by you, from which bill payments will be debited.</li><li>"Business Day" is every Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago holidays.</li><li>"Scheduled Payment Date" is the day you want your Payee to receive your bill payment and is also the day your Payment Account will be debited, unless the Scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-Business Day in which case it will be considered to be the previous Business Day.</li><li>"Due Date" is the date reflected on your Payee statement for which the payment is due; it is not the late date or grace period.</li><li>"Scheduled Payment" is a payment that has been scheduled through the Service but has not begun processing.</li><li>"Expedited Payment" is a payment funded through the Payment Account and scheduled for expedited processing, with the intent of obtaining next day payment of the Payee.</li><li>"ACH Debit" is an electronic payment from your Payment Account utilizing the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system. ACH Debits are subject to this Agreement and the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) rules, certain regulations and law.</li><li>"Direct Check" is a check that you authorize from your Payment Account utilizing the Service.</li></ul><br /><p><strong>PAYMENT SCHEDULING</strong></p><p>The earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Payee (typically four (4) or fewer Business Days from the current date) will be designated within the application when you are scheduling the payment. Therefore, the application will not permit you to select a Scheduled Payment Date less than the earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date designated for each Payee. When scheduling payments you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that is no later than the actual Due Date reflected on your Payee statement unless the Due Date falls on a non-Business Day. If the actual Due Date falls on a non-Business Day, you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that is at least one (1) Business Day before the actual Due Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any late date or grace period.</p><p><strong>THE SERVICE GUARANTEE</strong></p><p>Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Service, particularly delays in handling and posting payments by Payees or financial institutions, some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account with the Payee. The Service will bear responsibility for any late payment related charges up to $50.00 should a payment post after its Due Date as long as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the guidelines described under "Payment Scheduling" in this Agreement.</p><p><strong>PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION AND PAYMENT REMITTANCE</strong></p><p>By providing the Service with the names and account information of Payees to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize the Service to follow the Payment Instructions that it receives through the Service. In order to process payments more efficiently and effectively, the Service may edit or alter payment data or data formats in accordance with Payee directives.</p><p>When the Service receives a Payment Instruction, you authorize the Service to debit your Payment Account and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to the Scheduled Payment Date designated by you. You also authorize the Service to credit your Payment Account for payments returned to the Service by the United States Postal Service or Payee, or payments remitted to you on behalf of another authorized user of the Service.</p><p>The Service will use its best efforts to make all your payments properly. However, the Service shall incur no liability and any Service Guarantee shall be void if the Service is unable to complete any payments initiated by you because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:</p><ol><li>If, through no fault of the Service, your Payment Account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account;</li><li>The payment processing center is not working properly and you know or have been advised by the Service about the malfunction before you execute the transaction;</li><li>The Payee mishandles or delays a payment sent by the Service;</li><li>You have not provided the Service with the correct Payment Account information, or the correct name, address, phone number, or account information for the Payee; and/or,</li><li>Circumstances beyond control of the Service (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, or interference from an outside force) prevent the proper execution of the transaction and the Service has taken reasonable precautions to avoid those circumstances. Provided none of the foregoing exceptions are applicable, and the Service causes an incorrect amount of funds to be removed from your Payment Account or causes funds from your Payment Account to be directed to a Payee which does not comply with your Payment Instructions, the Service shall be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds to your Payment Account, and for directing to the proper Payee any previously misdirected transactions, and, if applicable, for any late payment related charges.</li></ol><p><strong>PAYMENT METHODS</strong></p><p>The Service reserves the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf to your Payee. These payment methods may include, but may not be limited to, an ACH Debit, an electronic to check payment, or a direct check or a laser draft payment (funds remitted to the Payee are deducted from your payment account when the laser draft is presented to your financial institution for payment).</p><p><strong>EXPEDITED PAYMENTS</strong></p><p>The Service will allow you to make Expedited Payments using the funds in your Payment Account for a fee. An Expedited Payment may be delivered to the Payee via ACH Debit or paper check mailed through an overnight service. Scheduled Payments are processed as batch transactions at the end of the Business Day. Expedited Payments, depending on the time the transaction was scheduled, may be processed with the Scheduled Payments, or immediately. Next day delivery of overnight checks may depend on the time of day that the transaction is scheduled, and is not guaranteed.</p><p><strong>PAYMENT CANCELLATION REQUESTS</strong></p><p>You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (including recurring payments) by following the directions within the application. There is no charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled Payment. Once the Service has begun processing a payment it cannot be cancelled or edited, therefore a stop payment request must be submitted, and an additional fee will be charged to your Payment Account, as designated by you.</p><p><strong>STOP PAYMENT REQUESTS</strong></p><p>The Service's ability to process a stop payment request will depend on the payment method and whether or not a check has cleared. The Service may also not have a reasonable opportunity to act on any stop payment request after a payment has been processed. If you desire to stop any payment that has already begun processing, you must contact Customer Service at <strong>+44 203 514 3631</strong>. Although the Service will make every effort to accommodate your request, the Service will have no liability for failing to do so. The Service may also require you to present your request in writing within fourteen (14) days. The charge for each stop payment request will be the current charge for such service as set out in the applicable fee schedule.</p><p><strong>PROHIBITED PAYMENTS</strong></p><p>Payments to Payees outside of the United States or its territories are prohibited through the Service.</p><p><strong>EXCEPTION PAYMENTS</strong></p><p>Tax payments and court ordered payments may be scheduled through the Service; however such payments are discouraged and must be scheduled at your own risk. In no event shall the Service be liable for any claims or damages resulting from your scheduling of these types of payments. The Service Guarantee as it applies to any late payment related changes is void when these types of payments are scheduled and/or processed by the Service. The Service has no obligation to research or resolve any claim resulting from an exception payment. All research and resolution for any misapplied, mis-posted or misdirected payments will be the sole responsibility of you and not of the Service or  EpicEuro .</p><p><strong>BILL DELIVERY AND PRESENTMENT</strong></p><p>This feature is for the presentment of electronic bills only and it is your sole responsibility to contact your Payees directly if you do not receive your statements.

Any changes will need to be made by contacting the Payee directly. Additionally it is your responsibility to maintain all User Names and Passwords for all electronic Payee sites. You also agree not to use someone else's information to gain unauthorized access to another person's bill.

Additionally, the ability to receive a paper copy of your statement(s) is at the sole discretion of the Payee. While your electronic bill feature is being activated it is your responsibility to keep your accounts current. Each electronic Payee reserves the right to accept or deny your request to receive electronic bills.</p><p><em>Authorization to obtain bill data</em> - Your activation of the electronic bill feature for a Payee shall be deemed by us to be your authorization for us to obtain bill data from the Payee on your behalf.

By providing us with such information, you authorize us to use the information to obtain your bill data and to share information with the Payee.</p><p><em>Notification</em> - The Service will use its best efforts to present all of your electronic bills promptly. In addition to notification within the Service, the Service may send an e-mail notification to the e-mail address listed for your account.

In the event you do not receive notification, it is your responsibility to periodically logon to the Service and check on the delivery of new electronic bills. The time for notification may vary from Payee to Payee. You are responsible for ensuring timely payment of all bills.</p><p><em>Cancellation of electronic bill notification</em> - The electronic Payee reserves the right to cancel the presentment of electronic bills at any time. You may cancel electronic bill presentment at any time. The timeframe for cancellation of your electronic bill presentment may vary from Payee to Payee. It may take up to sixty (60) days, depending on the billing cycle of each Payee. The Service will notify your electronic Payee(s) as to the change in status of your account and it is your sole responsibility to make arrangements for an alternative form of bill delivery. The Service will not be responsible for presenting any electronic bills that are already in process at the time of cancellation.</p><p><em>Non-Delivery of electronic bill(s)</em> - You agree to hold the Service and EpicEuro harmless should the Payee fail to deliver your statement(s). You are responsible for ensuring timely payment of all bills. Copies of previously delivered bills must be requested from the Payee directly.</p><p><em>Accuracy and dispute of electronic bill</em> - Neither the Service or EpicEuro is responsible for the accuracy of your electronic bill(s). The Service and/or EpicEuro is only responsible for presenting the information we receive from the Payee. Any discrepancies or disputes regarding the accuracy of your electronic bill summary or detail must be addressed with the Payee directly.</p><p>This Agreement does not alter your liability or obligations that currently exist between you and your Payees.</p><p><strong>EXCLUSIONS OF WARRANTIES</strong></p><p>THE SERVICE AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p><p><strong>PASSWORD AND SECURITY</strong></p><p>You agree not to give or make available your password or other means to access your account to any unauthorized individuals.

If you believe that your password or other means to access your account has been lost or stolen or that someone may attempt to use the Service without your consent or has transferred money without your permission, you must notify the Service at once by calling <strong>+44 203 514 3631</strong> or email <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#741d1a121b3411041d171101061b16151a1f5a171b19"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="066f6860694663766f65637374696467686d2865696b28">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p><p>All transactions initiated through the Service are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer disclosure provisions of your <a href="../online-banking-terms-conditions/index.html" title="Online Banking Terms &amp; Conditions">Online Banking Services Agreement</a> and are subject to the <a href="#" title="FirstMerit Bank Privacy Policy"> EpicEuro  Privacy Policy</a> as amended from time to time.

If you do not tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of such loss or theft, and we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized use of your password or other means to access your account if you had told us, you could be liable for as much as $500.00. If your monthly financial institution statement contains transfers that you did not authorize, you must tell us at once. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was sent to you, you may lose any amount transferred without your authorization after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) prevented you from telling us, we may extend the period.</p><p><strong>ERRORS AND QUESTIONS</strong></p><p>In case of errors or questions about your transactions, you should, as soon as possible, notify us via one of the following:</p><ol><li>Telephone us at <strong>+44 203 514 3631</strong> or email <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#adc4c3cbc2edc8ddc4cec8d8dfc2cfccc3c683cec2c0"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3851565e57785d48515b5d4d4a575a595653165b5755">[email&#160;protected]</span>;</a></li><li>Contact us by using the application's e-messaging feature; and/or,</li><li>Write us at:<br /> EpicEuro Bank, N.A.<br /> Customer Contact Center OPC 829<br /> 295 EpicEuro Circle<br /> Akron, Ohio 44307-2359</li></ol><p>If you think your statement is incorrect or you need more information about a Service transaction listed on the statement, we must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after the FIRST statement was sent to you on which the problem or error appears.
