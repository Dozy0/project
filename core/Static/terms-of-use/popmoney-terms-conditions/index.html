If we need more time in such cases, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do that, we will recredit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If, however, your complaint or question involves a transfer that was initiated outside the United States (including territories and possessions), the period within which we will tell you the results of our investigation is 10 business days after we hear from you or, at our option, 90 days thereafter, if we recredit your account within the 10 business day period. We will ask you to put your complaint or question in writing. If we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not recredit your account.</p><p>We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation.

Receipt of payments may be made through the Site and is subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations, in each case as in effect from time to time. In some instances, receipt of payments may be made through www.Popmoney.com (the "Popmoney Website") and if you choose to initiate or receive a payment at the Popmoney Website you acknowledge and agree that you shall be subject to the terms of other agreements, including, but not limited to, the "terms of use" for the Popmoney Website and applicable laws and regulations, in each case as in effect from time to time.</p><p><strong>2. Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance.</strong></p><ol type="a"><li>By providing us with names and telephone numbers, email addresses, and/or bank account information of Receivers to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize us to follow the Payment Instructions that we receive through the Service. Once registered, you authorize us to credit your Eligible Transaction Account for payments remitted to you on behalf of a Sender without further approval from you.<br /><br /></li><li>When we receive a Payment Instruction from you, you authorize us to debit your Eligible Transaction Account for the amount of any such Payment Instruction plus any related fees in effect (and as disclosed on the Site) at the time you initiate the Payment Instruction, and to remit funds on your behalf. You acknowledge and agree that any applicable fees will be charged when we receive a Payment Instruction from you, regardless of whether the Payment Instruction is ultimately completed. You also authorize us to credit your Eligible Transaction Account for the receipt of payments, including but not limited to those payments returned to us from Receivers to whom you sent payment(s) and those payments that were cancelled and returned to you because the processing of the Payment Instruction could not be completed.<br /><br /></li><li>You acknowledge and agree that if your Payment Instructions identify an account by name and account number, the relevant financial institution may execute those Payment Instructions by reference to the account number only, even if such account number does not correspond to the account name. You further acknowledge and agree that financial institutions holding the account may choose to not investigate discrepancies between account names and account numbers. We have no responsibility to investigate discrepancies between account names and account numbers, outside of our obligations under the law to investigate errors, described above in the Electronic Funds Transfers Disclosure above.<br /><br /></li><li>You agree that we will not be liable in any way for any payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.<br /><br /></li><li>We will use reasonable efforts to complete all your Payment Instructions properly. However, we shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete any transaction because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:<br /><br /><ol><li>If, through no fault of ours, the Eligible Transaction Account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the Payment Instruction or the Payment Instruction would exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account;</li><li>The Service is not working properly and you know or have been advised by us about the malfunction before you execute the Payment Instruction;</li><li>The payment is refused as described in Section 5 of the Popmoney Terms below;</li><li>You have not provided us with the correct information, including but not limited to the correct Payment Instructions or Eligible Transaction Account information, or the correct name and address or mobile phone number of the Receiver to whom you are initiating a Payment Instruction; and/or,</li><li>Circumstances beyond our control (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, network or system down time, issues with the financial institution, or interference from an outside force) prevent the proper execution of the Payment Instruction.</li></ol></li><li>It is the responsibility of the Sender and the Receiver to ensure the accuracy of any information that they enter into the Service (including but not limited to the Payment Instructions and name, telephone number and/or email address for the Receiver to whom you are attempting to send a payment), and for informing us as soon as possible if they become aware that this information is inaccurate. We will make a reasonable effort to stop or recover a payment made to the wrong person or entity once informed, but we do not guarantee such stoppage or recovery and will bear no responsibility or liability for damages resulting from incorrect information entered by the Sender or Receiver.</li></ol><p><strong>3. Initiation of Payment Instructions.</strong> You may initiate (a) a one-time Payment Instruction to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated immediately, (b) a one-time Payment Instruction to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated at a later specified date up to one (1) year, and (c) a recurring series of Payment Instructions to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated on the specified dates. Payment Instructions initiated to Receivers are processed in two ways. You can provide all the required information about the Receiver, including his/her Eligible Transaction Account, necessary to complete a transfer of funds. Alternatively, you can provide contact information about the Receiver (including an email address and/or mobile telephone number) and the Popmoney Service may contact the Receiver and request that the Receiver (i) provide information so that we may validate the identity of the Receiver at the Popmoney Website and then (ii) provide Eligible Transaction Account information in order to complete the Payment Instruction (a "Two-Step Transfer"). If the Receiver maintains an Eligible Transaction Account with an institution that participates in or offers the Popmoney Service, the Receiver may access the Popmoney Service at his or her financial institutionâs website or mobile application to complete the Payment Instruction and receive the payment.</p><p>You understand and agree that when you initiate a Payment Instruction from an Eligible Transaction Account using the Popmoney Service, the processing of the Payment Instruction will begin and the debiting of your Eligible Transaction Account will occur as early as the day of such initiation. However, the payment funds will be transferred into the Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account no earlier than the next Business Day after you initiated the Payment Instruction. If you request a one-time Payment Instruction to be initiated on a specified date or a recurring series of Payment Instruction to be initiated on specified dates, then the processing of the Payment Instruction will begin on the specified date and the debiting of your Eligible Transaction Account will occur as early as the specified date(s). However, the payment funds will be transferred into the Receiverâs Eligible Transaction Account no earlier than the next Business Day following the specified date. In addition, in the case of all Two-Step Transfers, the deposit of the payment funds into the Receiverâs Eligible Transaction Account (even if debited or withdrawn from your Eligible Transaction Account), or receipt of a gift card, if applicable, may be delayed if the Receiver has not provided the Popmoney Service with certain required information such as his or her Eligible Transaction Account information, or, in the case of a gift card, if applicable, a valid U.S. street address for gift cards that are physically delivered. The Site may contain additional information regarding the delivery of a payment to an Eligible Transaction Account or the delivery of a gift card, if applicable.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that we will begin to process the requested transfer of funds once the Receiver has provided (or we otherwise obtain) all required information, and you hereby authorize and direct us to retain such funds until the earlier of such time as the Receiver has provided (or we otherwise obtain) all required information or ten (10) Business Days. You further acknowledge and agree that our receipt of money to be transmitted to a Receiver shall not be deemed to have occurred and our obligation to complete a Payment Instruction shall not begin until such time as the Receiver provides us with (or we otherwise obtain) all required information necessary to process the related Payment Instruction in accordance with this Agreement. Any cancellation of a Payment Instruction prior to the Receiver providing us with such information shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5 of the Popmoney Terms, below.</p><p><strong>4. Receiving Payments.</strong> If another person wants to initiate a Payment Instruction (including in response to a Popmoney Request, if applicable) using the Popmoney Service to an Eligible Transaction Account you hold or, as applicable, if you as a Requestor want to initiate a Popmoney Request, he, she or you can do that from the Site or from an Eligible Transaction Account at a financial institution that participates in the Popmoney Service or at the Popmoney Website. Or, as applicable, if another person wants to send you a gift card using the Service, he or she can do that from an Eligible Transaction Account at a financial institution that participates in the Service and makes available the purchase of gift cards through the Service.</p><p>You understand and agree that there may be a delay between the time you are notified of the pending Payment Instruction and the deposit of the payment funds into your Eligible Transaction Account, and you may be required to take additional steps to facilitate the deposit of the payment of funds into your Eligible Transaction Account. You authorize the Sender, the financial institution which holds the Sender's Eligible Transaction Account and us (including through the Site) to send emails to you and text messages to your mobile phone in connection with the Sender's initiation of Payment Instructions to you, and, as a Receiver, you may also receive gift cards or Popmoney Requests, each as applicable, from others through the Service.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event that funds are transferred into your Eligible Transaction Account as a result of a Payment Instruction and it is determined that such transfer was improper because it was not authorized by the sender, because there were not sufficient funds in the sender's account, or for any other reason, then you hereby authorize us or our Service Provider to withdraw from your Eligible Transaction Account an amount equal to the amount of funds improperly transferred to you.</p><p>If applicable, if you as a Requestor initiate a Popmoney Request using the Service you acknowledge and agree that as disclosed on the Site (a) the applicable service fee will be deducted from payments received by you from a Sender(s), and (b) no service fee will be charged if you as the Requestor do not receive any payments from the individuals to whom the Popmoney Request is sent. Further details about the foregoing can be found on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that individuals to whom you send a Popmoney Request may not receive, or otherwise may reject or ignore, your Popmoney Request. We do not guarantee that you will receive any payments from individuals by initiating a Popmoney Request.</p><p><strong>5. Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments.</strong> Sender may cancel the initiation of a Payment Instruction or stop a Payment Instruction at any time until the processing of the Payment Instruction into the Receiverâs Eligible Transaction Account has begun. Our ability to stop a Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction will depend on the manner in which the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction to the Receiverâs Eligible Transaction Account has begun processing. Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment request and to recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction, we will have no liability for failing to do so. We will require you to present your stop payment request or request to recover funds in writing within fourteen (14) days after contacting +44 203 514 3631. If we charge you to stop the payment or recover funds, then the charge for each stop payment or fund recovery request will be the current charge as set out in our current fee schedule. Payments not claimed by a Receiver will be automatically cancelled ten (10) days after the processing of the payment begins. When a Sender initiates a Payment Instruction, the Receiver is not required to accept the payment. You agree that you as a Sender will not hold us liable for any damages resulting from a Receiverâs decision to accept or not to accept a Payment Instruction initiated or attempted through the Service. We will, to the extent permitted by law, make reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.</p><p><strong>6. Mobile Phone Users.</strong> Your phone service provider is not the provider of the Service. Users of the Service will receive text messages relating to their Payment Instructions and other notices from time to time if a mobile phone number is provided. Data and messaging charges from your telecommunications provider may apply, and you are responsible for any such charges. In the event your enrolled mobile device is lost or stolen, you agree to update your enrollment information and make the appropriate changes to disable the use of such device. You understand that there are risks associated with using a mobile device, and that in the event of theft or loss, your confidential information could be compromised. If you have questions about mobile service, you may send a text message with the word "HELP" to this number: 767666. To stop receiving text messages on your mobile phone, text "STOP" to this number: 767666.</p><p><strong>7. Service Fees and Additional Charges.</strong> You are responsible for paying all fees associated with your use of the Service. Applicable fees will be disclosed in the user interface for, or elsewhere within, the Service or Site. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY APPLICABLE FEES WILL BE CHARGED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PAYMENT INSTRUCTION IS COMPLETED, UNLESS THE FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE INSTRUCTION IS SOLELY DUE TO OUR FAULT, except for those fees that are specifically use-based, such as Request Money, if applicable. There may be a charge for additional transactions and other optional services. You agree to pay such charges and authorize us to deduct the calculated amount from your designated Eligible Transaction Account for these amounts and any additional charges that may be incurred by you. Any financial fees associated with your standard deposit accounts (or Other Eligible Transaction Accounts) will continue to apply. You are responsible for any and all telephone access fees and Internet service fees that may be assessed by your telephone and Internet service provider. The <strong>Failed or Returned Payment Instructions</strong> section above applies if you do not pay our fees and charges for the Service, including without limitation if we debit the Eligible Transaction Account for such fees, as described in this Section, and there are insufficient fees in the Eligible Transaction Account.</p><p><strong>8. Refused Payments.</strong> We reserve the right to refuse to pay any Receiver. We will attempt to notify the Sender promptly if we decide to refuse to pay a Receiver designated by the Sender. This notification is not required if you attempt to make a prohibited payment under this Agreement.</p><p><strong>9. Returned Payments.</strong> In using the Service, you understand that Receivers may reject Payment Instructions or otherwise return payments. We will use reasonable efforts to complete Payment Instructions initiated through the Service.</p><p><strong>10. Definitions.</strong></p><p>"Popmoney Request" means functionality that, if provided to you, allows a Requestor to request that another individual initiate a Payment Instruction to the Requestor through the Popmoney Service.</p><p>"Receiver" is a person or business entity that is sent a Payment Instruction through the Service.</p><p>"Requestor" is a person that requests an individual to initiate a Payment Instruction through the Popmoney Service.</p><p>"Sender" is a person or business entity that sends a Payment Instruction through the Service.</p></div>
