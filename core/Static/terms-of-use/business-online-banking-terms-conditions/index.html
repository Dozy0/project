You will be issued a single user name and password for accessing the accounts of your business. You are responsible for keeping it confidential.<br /><br />YOUR AFFIRMATIVE ACT OF TYPING IN YOUR USER NAME AND CLICKING EITHER "SUBMIT" OR "LOG IN" CONSTITUTES YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AND AGREEMENT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br /><br />Please review these terms carefully. In addition to traditional paper based communications, <strong>by signing up or using  EpicEuro âs OnlineÂ Banking service, you agree to transact with and receive notices from EpicEuro electronically (see the</strong> <strong><a href="../consent-for-electronic-communication/index.html" title="Consent for Electronic Communication">Consent for Electronic Communications</a></strong><strong>). YouÂ alsoÂ consent to the information practices disclosed in  EpicEuro âs Privacy and Security Principles.</strong> You may wish to print this agreement for your future reference.

Transfers of funds will be effective on the banking day they are made. You may also transfer funds from a checking or savings account, made accessible to you via the Internet, to a EpicEuro loan (credit card, mortgage loan, line of credit or installment loan). Payment transfers will reflect on your checking or savings account the next banking day. Posting of the payment transfer onto the loan may take place on the next banking day if the transfer is made after our cut-off time.<br /><br /> If you enroll and are accepted, you may transfer funds between EpicEuro and deposit accounts at other financial institutions, brokerage firms, etc. (external accounts). The external accounts must be accessible to you via the Internet and verified and approved by  EpicEuro . These external transfers will be processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network and its applicable rules. However, should EpicEuro choose to utilize a different process or the ACH network becomes unavailable, you agree that EpicEuro may perform the external transfer service through other means. Initially and from time to time thereafter, EpicEuro may verify the external accounts by performing a test transfer, in which one or more low value amounts, may be both credited to and/or debited from the external accounts. Once the test transfer(s) are complete, we may ask you to access your external account to tell us the amount of the test credit and/or debit, as well as any other information reported by the external account institution.  EpicEuro , in its sole discretion, may require other or additional verification methods. External transfers may be scheduled to occur once, for a future date or on a specified recurring basis.  EpicEuro , in its sole discretion, may set limits on external transfers with regards to amounts, number of transfers, timing of transfers, etc. <a href="../online-mobile-banking-fee-schedule/index.html" title="Online &amp; Mobile Banking Fee Schedule">View further information on limits</a>. These limits are in addition to the limits described below. If you have registered for our online bill pay service, you may make payments to third parties from your designated bill pay checking account. These payments are subject to both this agreement and the separate Online Bill Pay Terms and Conditions.<br /><br />Because of federal law, you may make no more than six transfers per statement cycle from each of your savings and money market deposit accounts including transfers made via the Internet and any other transfers from these accounts via pre-authorized transfer, telephone or check. Failure to adhere to these limitations could result in the conversion of your account to a transaction (checking) account or in the case of savings accounts, the closure of your account. You may make unlimited transfers from these accounts in person or at an ATM.<br /><br /> For purposes of this agreement, a banking day is Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays on which the bank is closed. If made on a non-banking day or after our cut-off times, they will be effective on the next banking day. There must be sufficient funds in your account on the banking day of the transfer in order to complete the transfer. If sufficient funds are not available to complete the transfer, the transfer may not be completed, and you may be charged any applicable fees. You will receive a tracking ID and confirmation message for any transfers you make. If you do not receive a confirmation after requesting a transfer to be made, it may not have been completed. Posting of the payment transfer onto the loan may take longer.<br /><br /><strong>3. Termination</strong><br />Use of this website, other than as permitted by thisÂ agreement or any other terms and conditions, will result in the immediate termination of your access to online banking services. We reserve the right to terminate your access to or use of this service, or any portion thereof, without notice and without limitation, for any reason, including a violation of the conditions and restrictions in this agreement or any other applicable agreement. EpicEuro shall have no liability to you for such termination.<br /><br />You may terminate use of online banking services at any time by calling us at +44 203 514 3631 or writing to us at:<br /><br />EpicEuro Bank N.A.<br />Online Banking Dept. - OPC 849<br />295 EpicEuro Circle<br />Akron, Ohio 44307<br /><br />You must notify us at least ten (10) days before the date on which you wish your service to be terminated. Termination will apply to your access to all of your accounts that have been made accessible via the Internet. Regardless of how or when you first notify us, we may ask you to verify such request in writing.<br /><br /> From time to time, EpicEuro will terminate and purge those online banking customers who have not accessed or utilized the service for an extended period of time. Should your access be terminated due to lack of use, you will be permitted to re-enroll.<br /><br />Termination of your service does not affect your obligations under this agreement for any transactions you have conducted or instructions you have submitted, nor does it affect the terms and conditions of any other products or services you continue to maintain with  EpicEuro .<br /><br /><strong>4.
